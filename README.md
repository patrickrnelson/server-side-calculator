Server Side Calculator

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Challenge_

The second weekend challenge of Prime Digital Academy. The challenge was to create a client-side calculator that sends the inputs (data) to a server, calculates on the server, sends the information back to the client, displays the answer prominently for the user, and keeps a record of all previous calculations for the user to see.
